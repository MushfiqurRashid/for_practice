# High Level Project Summary  

Welcome to our comprehensive and captivating website dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the ocean and its vital contributions to our environment. Our project is not only an educational endeavor but also a tribute to the ocean's profound importance in our lives.

**Home:** Here, we present an overview of our project, delving into the "why" behind our mission. We explain why understanding the ocean is crucial, highlighting how it impacts every facet of our existence, even in landlocked regions. By setting the stage for our exploration, we emphasize the importance of our project in bridging the gap between people and the ocean.

**Explore:** Dive into the depths of the ocean through our stunning 3D visualizations. Embark on an immersive journey to various ocean layers, encountering a diverse array of marine life, from the smallest phytoplankton to the most majestic sea creatures. Our interactive visualizations allow you to explore the ocean's intricate ecosystems like never before.

**Learn:** Knowledge is power, and our "Learn" page is a treasure trove of insights. We break down complex scientific concepts into easily digestible nuggets of wisdom. Discover why phytoplankton are the unsung heroes of our planet, learn about marine food chains, explore Ocean Provided Services, and gain a deeper understanding of the Carbon Cycle, climate change, ocean health, and the wealth of resources the ocean provides. Through engaging videos, animations, and 3D models, we demystify the ocean's workings and draw parallels to a lush garden for relatable comprehension.

**Game:** Learning can be fun, and our exploration game proves just that. Playfully engage with the ocean's role in our environment, unlocking the mysteries and challenges it presents. Test your knowledge and embark on a thrilling adventure that reinforces your understanding of the ocean's significance.

**Live Observation:** We bring the ocean closer to you through real-time Earth observations from NASA's Earth API (EOSDIS). Explore different regions of the ocean and witness its dynamic beauty from the vantage point of satellites. With stunning images courtesy of NASA, you'll gain a newfound appreciation for the vastness and diversity of our oceanic world.

In essence, our entire website is a testament to the wonders of the ocean, using NASA's invaluable resources to inspire and educate. Join us on this enlightening journey to uncover the ocean's secrets and recognize its pivotal role as our planet's life-sustaining garden. Together, we'll foster a deeper connection to the ocean and a commitment to its preservation for generations to come.


## How it works
The website follows a straightforward architecture: it's a user-centric platform with five pages (Home, Explore, Learn, Game, and Live Observation). The primary interaction happens through the website's interface. The unique feature is the Live Observation page, which fetches real-time data from NASA's EOSDIS API, providing users with up-to-date information and imagery. The other pages offer engaging content and experiences related to the ocean's importance and ecosystem, all seamlessly accessible through the website's user-friendly design.
